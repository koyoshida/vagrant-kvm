# Vagrant KVM Provider

This is a [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) 1.1+ plugin that adds a KVM
provider to Vagrant, allowing Vagrant to control and provision KVM/QEMU VM.

## Requirements

This plugin requires QEMU 1.2+, it has only been tested on Fedora 18+,
Debian Wheezy, Ubuntu 12.04(LTS) Precise and Ubuntu 13.04 Raring at the moment.

This plugin requires redir package, and `libvirt-dev` (Debian/Ubuntu) or
`libvirt-devel` (openSUSE)

You can use a backported KVM/QEMU 1.4 with Private Package Archive(PPA)
for Ubuntu 12.04(LTS) at https://launchpad.net/~miurahr/+archive/vagrant

## Recent changes

Default image format is now qcow2 instead of sparsed raw imagei, with qcow2
`vagrant-kvm` uses the box volume as a backing volume so that VM creation is
a lot faster. In most cases you want to use qcow2.

OVF boxes conversion as been removed, you should use `vagrant-mutate` instead.

## Features/Limitations

* Provides the same workflow as the Vagrant VirtualBox provider.
* Uses NFS for sync folders
* Only works with 1 VM per Vagrantfile for now
* Requires "libvirtd" group membership to run Vagrant (Debian/Ubuntu only)
* Requires backporting qemu and libvirt from experimental (Debian) or raring (Ubuntu)
* Use qcow2 backing image by default, which should make VM creation very fast

## Usage

Install using standard Vagrant 1.1+ plugin installation methods. After
installing, `vagrant up` and specify the `kvm` provider. An example is
shown below.

```bash
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-kvm
$ vagrant up --provider=kvm
```

Of course prior to doing this, you'll need to obtain a KVM-compatible
box file for Vagrant. You can convert a VirtualBox base box using
`vagrant-mutate` https://github.com/sciurus/vagrant-mutate or see the sample
box.

You will need a private network specifying an IP address in your Vagrantfile,
the minimum Vagrantfile would then be:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "precise32"
  config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.192.10"
end
```

And then run `vagrant up --provider=kvm`.

If you always use kvm provider as default, please set it in your .bashrc:

```bash
export VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=kvm
```
then you can simply run `vagrant up` with kvm provider.

## Configuration

There are some provider specific parameter to control VM definition.

* `cpu_model` - cpu architecture: 'i686' or 'x86_64': default is x86_64. Note
  that your base box should specify this.
* `core_number` - number of cpu cores.
* `memory_size` - memory size such as 512m, 1GiB, 100000KiB, unit is KiB if
  unspecified.
* `gui` - boolean for starting VM with VNC enabled.
* `vnc_port` - The port the VNC server listens to. Default is automatic port
assignment.
* `vnc_autoport` - if true, KVM will automatically assign a port for VNC
to listen to. Defaults to false, but the default vnc_port is -1, which results
in this flag being automatically turned on by KVM.
* `vnc_password ` - A password used to protect the VNC session.
* `image_type` - an image format for vm disk: 'raw' or 'qcow2': default is "qcow2"
  When choosing 'raw', vagrant-kvm always convert box image into storage-pool,
  which consumes disk space and is a longer process. Recommendation is 'qcow2'.
* `machine_type` - The type of machine to boot. Default is pc-1.2.
* `network_model` - The model of the network adapter you want to use. Defaults
to virtio. Can be set to `:default` if you want to use the KVM default setting.
Possible values include: ne2k_isa i82551 i82557b i82559er ne2k_pci pcnet rtl8139 e1000 virtio.
* `video_model` - The model of the video adapter. Default to cirrus. Can also be
set to vga.

## Specs

To run specs, you first need to add and prepare the Vagrant box which will be used.

```bash
$ bundle exec rake box:add
$ bundle exec rake box:prepare
```

Once box is added and prepared, you can run specs:

```bash
$ bundle exec rake spec
```

When you're done, feel free to remove the box.

```bash
$ bundle exec rake box:remove
```

If you're Mac user and you have Vagrant and VMware Fusion, you can use bundled box for development. See `spec/Vagrantfile` for details.
